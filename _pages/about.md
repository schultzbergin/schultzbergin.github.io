I am a philosopher specializing in political philosophy and applied ethics. As a philosopher, I am interested in foundational questions about our existence and social organization: What justifies the exercise of political authority? How ought diverse peoples organize to live together peaceably? What does it mean to be free in a complex and interdependent society? How should we design and implement technology to improve well-being? I explore these questions in both scholarly outlets and through engaging with the public. My scholarly work can be found on my [Publications](/publications/) page, while my public work can be found at my [All's Good Substack](https://allsgood.substack.com/).

Along with my research, I regularly teach at Cleveland State University. Much of my teaching focuses on engineering and technology ethics as well as political and legal philosophy. I embrace the science of learning, advances in instructional strategies, and alternative approaches to assessment and grading. As a result, my courses are highly collaborative: I focus on helping students develop their philosophical abilities through engaging collaboratively in philosophy with their peers. Additionally, I emphasize the value of feedback loops for learning by evaluating major work based on reaching a threshold of competency and providing avenues for re-attempts and revisions to meet the standards.

Finally, I am currently Cleveland State University's Core Curriculum Director as we reimagine and launch an exciting new general education program. I functioned as faculty chair of the redesign committee before accepting the administrative position overseeing its implementation. I am excited to see the program launch in Fall 2025, with its focus on engaging students in intellectual inquiry, producing authentic signature work, and guiding students in making meaning of their learning.
