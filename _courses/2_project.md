<h2>Course Overview</h2>
What is the purpose of a legal system? The nature of legal authority? How does the law relate to morality? How should we interpret laws and constitutions? What (if anything) justifies legal punishment?

Legal Philosophy, also known as Jurisprudence, investigates these and related questions. We will examine various answers and debates, with a focus on understanding the theories and arguments. Along the way we will work to develop your philosophical abilities, including charitably interpreting multiple perspectives on issues, constructing arguments, and effectively communicating philosophical ideas.

<h2>Course Highlights</h2>
* Examines the development of *Legal Positivism*, including an examination of the Inclusive/Exclusive Positivist debate that is typically excluded from such courses.
* Leverages Ronald Dworkin's *Law as Integrity* theory to interrogate debates over legal, and especially constitutional, interpretation
* Examines contemporary literature on legal punishment and not just the classic debates
